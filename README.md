# Watermark App (Windows Only)

## Purpose
This application is designed to allow users to create a watermarked image using any image as the watermark. It provides a range of features that make the watermarking process seamless and customizable, catering to both casual users and professionals.

## Features
- **Multi-Watermark Input**: Users can input as many images as they like, making it possible to apply multiple watermarks on a single image.
- **Image Resizing**: Adjust the size of any image to fit your watermarking needs.
- **Opacity Adjustment**: Control the transparency of the watermark to achieve the perfect balance between visibility and subtlety.
- **Alignment Tools and Grid**: Built-in tools and a grid overlay help users precisely align their watermark.
- **Zoom Functionality**: Zoom in and out for a closer look at the details without altering the original pixel size of the image.

## Users
This app is for anyone who wants to add watermarks to their images, whether for personal branding, copyright protection, or artistic purposes.

## Technology
- **Programming Language**: Python 3.11
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: `ttkinter`
- **Image Manipulation**: `PIL` (Python Imaging Library)

## Platform
- **Desktop Application**: Tested on Windows (compatibility with other operating systems may require further testing).
